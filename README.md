üêç Eunectes murinus - Snake Game in C++
Created by: Sara Hisham - Rayan Gurashi

1. DESCRIPTION

Eunectes murinus is a console-based Snake game developed in C++ using 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

The player controls a snake that moves around the screen to eat food. 
Each time the snake eats, it grows longer. The goal is to survive as 
long as possible without crashing into the walls or the snake's own body.

The name Eunectes murinus refers to the green anaconda, one of the 
largest snakes in the world - just like your snake in the game can 
grow to great lengths!
